Concrete is the most used material for construction in the world! There are some components that should be combined to make the concrete. 
These components can affect the compressive strength of the concrete.
We have to come up with ML solution to predict the strenght of the concrete which helps reducing risks during construction.
Implementing multiple regression models to fit the best model for the dataset.
